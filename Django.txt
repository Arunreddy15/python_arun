In web applications one thing is very famous "MVC"-Model View Controller.
Model-Its for data.
View- Its what we see on screen.
Controller- Which controls the operations.

But in Django we have "MVT"-Model View Templet.

Major reason to use Django even we have other frameworks in python, because django is faster than that.
